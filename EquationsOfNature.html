<div id = "top"> The Equations of Nature </div>

<div id = "main">
    <p>
        I’ve always been interested in graphics and design.
        Because of my complete inability to draw, as well as
        my general laziness towards learning how to, I’ve never
        been able to achieve anything interesting on paper.
        The use of computer graphics however, allowed me to use elegant
        mathematical equations to create, if not realistic natural objects,
        at least symbolic representations of those.
    </p>

    <p>
        It all started when I wished to offer my girlfriend flowers.
        I was looking for something more original, and perhaps more interactive and durable than regular flowers.
        In order to obtain the variety and random character of nature, there needs to be a way to “generate”
        the plants in a somewhat dynamic fashion.
        As it happens, evolution has shaped the petals of flowers to grow in an almost mathematical way.
        The lines drawn by variations of sinusoids plotted in polar coordinates easily end up looking like
        the petals of simple flowers. Or at least our biased human brains make them look so.
    </p>

    <p>
        In polar coordinates, a sinusoid will take the form:
        <br>
    <p>r  = k cos (theta)
        <br>
        <br>
        r being the radius, theta the angle and k an arbitrary number which will have an influence on the shape of the curve.
    </p>

    <p>
        If k = 1, then the curve will simply be a circle.
        If k is an integer, then the curve will describe a
        shape similar to petals, k if k is odd, and 2k if k
        is even. Non-integer values will affect the shape in
        more complex ways. In particular, if k is rational,
        then the curve will eventually close itself. In the case
        where is irrationnal, such as with the square root of two, or
        pi, then the curve will continue indefinitely, without ever going back to meet its starting point.
